/**
 * Self-chaining cache-warming endpoint.
 *
 * Warms one batch of routes in a fresh function invocation, then triggers the
 * next link in the chain until the route list is drained (or the overall cap
 * is reached). Decoupling each batch into its own invocation lets us warm an
 * arbitrarily long route list without blowing any single function's lifetime.
 *
 * Internal-only: requests are authenticated by an HMAC signature derived from
 * the Supabase service-role key (see cacheService). No user-configured secret
 * is required, so self-hosters get full warming out of the box.
